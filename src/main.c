	Sample:

	0 (first parameter) will map to first element of linxh[] function as it is x1
	21 (second parameter) will map to first element of level1yh[] function as it is y1
	lastly the corresponding value in the last function is of the formula: x2 - x1,
	in this example it is 21 (third parameter) - 0 (first parameter) = 21 which goes 
	into the last function in the same index as you put your other values

	IMPORTANT: the function drawLine(0,21,21,21,0); format is IMPORTANT, the first two 
	values (x1 and y1) must be the points CLOSEST TO THE TOP LEFT CORNER i.e. their values
	should be equal to or less than the second set of values in this example, (0,21) is equal
	to or less than (21,21) thus you can use the template above, if your drawline functions 
	are different to this layout the above WILL NOT WORK, either you must rearrange your 
	original drawline functions to match the above template or reshuffle where you pass
	each parameter.

	NOTE: THIS TEMPLATE IS ONLY FOR THE HORIZONTAL LINE FUNCTIONS, VERTICAL LINES BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY
